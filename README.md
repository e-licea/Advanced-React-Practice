# Sprint Practice: Advanced React - Men's Football/Soccer Rankings

## Project Set
Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.

- [ ] Clone your OWN version of Repo. **(Not Lambda's by mistake!)**
- [ ] Create a new Branch locally: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
- [ ] Run the server using `npm start` or `node server.js`.
- [ ] In a separate terminal cd into the `client` folder and run `npm install` to download dependencies.
- [ ] Still inside the `client` folder run `npm start` to run the client application.
- [ ] Implement the project on this Branch, **committing progress & changes often.**
- [ ] Push commits: `git push origin <firstName-lastName>`.

## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

- [ x ] Class component that fetches data from the server you now have running - the data can be fetched from `http://localhost:5000/api/players`
- [ x ] Display the player data you receive from the API
- [ x ] Build a custom hook and use it in your app - this can be a localStorage hook, a fetch hook, a dark mode hook, or any other hook you would like
- [ ] Write a "reasonable" amount of unit tests for your React components. What does "reasonable amount" mean? That is up to you to decide. Be ready to defend your choice to your TL üëç

## Stretch Problems

- [ ] Implement another custom hook
- [ ] Use a graphing library to graph the data you received from the API
